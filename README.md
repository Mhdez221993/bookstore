# BookList
The Bookstore is a website similar to the "Awesome Books" website built in the previous module. I will create an MVP version of it that allows you me:

* Display a list of books.
* Add a book.
* Remove a selected book.

The app will use the "feature folder" approach. I will also set up routing using React Router.

## Built With
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Webpack
- HTML/SCSS
- Node.JS
- Jest


## Getting Started

```cmd
git clone  git@github.com:Mhdez221993/bookstore.git
cd bookstore
npm install
npm start
```

## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.


### `npm run build` fails to minify
